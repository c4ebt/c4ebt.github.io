Most of the writeups I will post will not be entry-level PWNs - and some people have asked for them - , so here you have some resources to work your way up learning PWN.

[separator]: <> ()

You shouldn't restrict yourself to this learning paths, these are just the resources I've used and simple recommendations.


- [Introduction to the Buffer Overflow concept](https://youtu.be/1S0aBV-Waeo)
- [Great serie explaining multiple types of Buffer Overflows and what happens under the hood](https://youtu.be/iyAyN3GFM7A)
- [Good Buffer Overflow practice](https://exploit.education/protostar/)
- [Introduction and practice to ROP Chains](https://ropemporium.com/)

Overall just keep practicing with CTF challenges and reading writeups about new things :D
